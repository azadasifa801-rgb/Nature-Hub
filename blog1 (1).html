      <p>
        One of the most common and irritating issues many people face is an itchy scalp with buildup. It can feel frustrating—
        and while it may seem like a minor problem, it isn’t.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Attention!</strong> If left unaddressed, scalp buildup and itching can increase the risk of hair and scalp problems like hair loss, dandruff, and infections.
        A healthy scalp is essential for healthy-looking hair. Below are common triggers and effective solutions.

      <h2>Causes Triggering Buildup and Itching</h2>

      <h3>1) Product Buildup</h3>
      <p>
        Be cautious if you use many products. Harsh shampoos, conditioners, styling gels, and dry shampoos can accumulate on the scalp and clog hair follicles,
        leading to irritation and itching—especially when used frequently.
      </p>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Minimize the use of harsh shampoos and conditioners, and rinse thoroughly.</p>

      <h3>2) Sebum Overproduction</h3>
      <p>
        A major and natural cause of scalp buildup is excess oil (sebum) production. The scalp produces oil to keep hair moisturized, but when it overproduces,
        the excess can trap dirt and dead skin, causing buildup and itchiness.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Dandruff and Dry Scalp</h3>
      <p>
        White, irritating flakes may be due to a yeast-like fungus (<em>Malassezia</em>) or skin conditions like seborrheic dermatitis.
        Dry air and harsh weather can also reduce moisture, making flaking and irritation worse.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Allergies or Sensitivities</h3>
      <p>
        Fragrances, sulfates, and certain preservatives in hair products can trigger allergic reactions and scalp irritation—especially if you have sensitive skin.
      </p>

      <h3>5) Lifestyle Factors</h3>
      <p>
        Lifestyle often gets overlooked. Poor hygiene habits, stress, lack of sleep, and an unbalanced diet can increase scalp issues, contributing to oiliness or dryness.
